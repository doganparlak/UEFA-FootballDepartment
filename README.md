# Metric Implementations and Technical Analysis Applications

This project focuses on implementing football metrics utilizing tracking and event data sourced from UEFA. The metrics cover various aspects including ball location, press classification, progression classification, pass classification, running total of ball out of play, and running total of effective time. The match to be analyzed was LOSC vs Ajax Amsterdam, which took place in the Champions League on November 27, 2019.
